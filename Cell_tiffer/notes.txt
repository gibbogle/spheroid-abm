OLD NOTES TO BUILD 64-bit PROGRAM WITH ITK64
--------------------------------------------
To link to 64-bit ITK libraries, a 64-bit Qt program must be built with cmake in QtCreator.
The CMakeLists.txt file is processed by cmake selecting the MSVC++ 2010 (x64) generator, and 
the release build is selected by setting the parameter:

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

To ensure that the 64-bit Qt libraries are found the PATH variable must be set.
This is done by executing runQtCreator64.bat first.

Note that for the 32-bit Qt Creator build to work the 32-bit libraries must appear in the PATH
before the 64-bit versions.

NOTES TO BUILD 32-bit PROGRAM
-----------------------------
Now that ITK32MSVS has been built (ITK-4.7.2 with MSVC2010) -> C:\Program Files (x86)\ITK
it is possible to build a fully 32-bit Qt-ITK with Qt-4.8.1-MSVC2010

* Open QtCreator, e.g. by clicking on runQtCreator.bat
* Open existing project: CMakeLists.txt

Note that:
* environment variables QTDIR and ITK_DIR have been changed.
* paths to ITK\bin and ITK\lib have been changed
* path to Qt\...\bin has been changed

To use the 64-bit ITK libraries for the ln_structure programs the 64-bit ITK path will need to be restored.
