The user selects a file that holds cell locations at an instant.

voxelsize - the size of a voxel in um - provides the image scale.

A thick slice is defined by its central z position, and by its thickness.  
The z position is determined by the distance from the spheroid centre,
expressed as a fraction of the spheroid radius: -1 < zfraction < 1.
where 0 corresponds to the centre.

The program determines the 2D projection of this slice, in which
voxels that fall within a cell are lit (255).  To be precise:
the pixel value at (x,y) = 255 if for any z in the range(z1,z2)
(x,y,z) corresponds to a point that is inside a cell, where
z1 <= z <= z2 defines the range of the slice.
